# About Me

Hi! I'm Michael Breedlove. I am a student at Columbia College Chicago, and I aim to major in computer programming. I have a keen interest in game design, and have been a 
SourceMod plugin author for Team Fortress 2 for a few years now as a hobby. I thoroughly enjoy my work, especially when it allows me to flex my creative muscles.

## Week 1: Introduction

+ Created this GitHub repository.
+ Added previous code demonstrating my understanding of constant, linear, and quadratic time.
