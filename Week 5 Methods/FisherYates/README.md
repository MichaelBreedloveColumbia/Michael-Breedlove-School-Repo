# Overview
The subject of this assignment was very simple: all we had to do was create a program which demonstrated a Fisher-Yates shuffle. 

In essence, the Fisher-Yates shuffle can be described as a very simple algorithm, by which the order of a set of data is randomized. For example, if I have a set of integers in the order of [10, 2, 7, 8], a Fisher-Yates shuffle might turn it into [2, 8, 10, 7]. 

To capitalize on this simplicity, I chose to handle this assignment by first creating a list of integers, then randomizing their positions.
